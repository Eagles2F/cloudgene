Cloudgene
=========

Cloudgene is an open source platform to improve the usability of MapReduce programs in Bioinformatics. It provides a graphical web interface for launching a MapReduce cluster on Amazon EC2 (called Cloudge Public Mode) and an interface for the execution, the import/export of data and the reproducibility of MapReduce workflows (Cloudgene Private Mode). New MapReduce programs can be integrated without altering the source code using its integrated plugin interface.
